<p>I am writing to inquire about the RFP list for the {event_name}. By partnering with us, we can help you save budget dollars while ensuring worry-free, world-class service. We take pride in building long-lasting relationships with our clients, as evidenced by the positive feedback we have received from clients nationwide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is with much enthusiasm that I recommend the services of NxtgenEvents. They know our programs like the back of their hands, anticipate our needs, are excellent in trouble shooting onsite and competitively priced. The crew is very professional and experts in their field. In fact, since they excel in their services, it&rsquo;s the least challenging portion of my job. Again, I highly recommend NxtgenEvents and their highly experienced and professional team&rdquo;.<br>
- Bridgette Brigham, Senior Conference Manager, Technical Association of the Paper &amp; Pulp Industry (TAPPI)<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;I wanted to let you know that your team has done an exceptional job this week! They have been so on top of it and I think this conference ran more smoothly than any conference we&rsquo;ve ever done. My team here and I are very grateful!&rdquo; <br>

 <br>
&ldquo;We highly recommend working with NxtgenEvents! We&rsquo;ve worked with Bill and his team for both of our conferences in 2018 and 2021. As we shifted to a hybrid conference in 2021, the NxtgenEvents team guided us through this new-to-us territory seamlessly, from creating our virtual platform and prepping our virtual speakers to pulling off a custom, hybrid networking experience, which was no small task. We appreciate the close-knit feel of his team and the on-site staff, and we look forward to working with them for our future conferences.&rdquo;<br>
